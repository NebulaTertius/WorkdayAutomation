General Development Notes:

To Do On Prod:
Create INCENTIVE Earning Line on FOX
Create REFERRAL_PAY Earning line on AMCS


Nice to Haves:
Recon Assitance - identify issues such as multiple active employees
Re-process historic records
Option to keep history data when creating structures. (Do not do through SQL, as the EXEC sp_rename does not allow for the table to be dropped by a dynamic SQL afterwards.)



Add levels of checks on new employee records to look at names, id numbers etc, to try warn about a duplicate employee with different emp codes
Or
Add a validation section that will add to warning/error message to supply additional information. Eg: Reinstated event, but including a termination date.
This would most likely mean a change to an old termination, which could just be ignored.



Terminations:
Add an option to include leave for terminated employees, to show if all leave has been removed,
And then add calcs or checks to pay this out.


Not related to this project:
Sage Reporting Tool: Create a query/report assistant. Give options to create a report, such as "Use employee or entity", "Consolidate or per payslip"
As well as things such as a Summary or Detail view, to also assist in building the report layout itself.
